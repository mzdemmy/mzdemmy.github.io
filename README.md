# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I've creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to  navigate between them. These pages contain visualizations and their corresponding explanations. From the landing page, you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and access a page where you can view the data used to build them.
